# Kick.com Integration Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the AI Moderator Bot with Kick.com.

## Overview

The AI Moderator Bot supports Kick.com as a moderation platform alongside Twitch. The bot can run on both platforms simultaneously or individually, with unified voice commands and cross-platform username resolution.

## Features

### Supported Actions on Kick

**Direct API Support:**
- âœ… Ban users (permanent)
- âœ… Timeout users (with duration)
- âœ… Unban/untimeout users
- âœ… Send chat messages

**Chat Mode Commands (via chat messages):**
- âœ… Clear chat (`/clear`)
- âœ… Slow mode (`/slow on/off [seconds]`)
- âœ… Followers-only mode (`/followonly on/off [minutes]`)
- âœ… Emote-only mode (`/emoteonly on/off`)
- âœ… Subscribers-only mode (`/subonly on/off`)

> **Note:** Since Kick's API doesn't currently support chat mode commands directly, these commands are sent as regular chat messages that moderators can execute. The bot will send the command (e.g., `/slow on 30`) followed by a confirmation message.

### Voice Commands

All voice commands work the same way as on Twitch:
- "Hey Brian, ban username"
- "Hey Brian, timeout username for 10 minutes"
- "Hey Brian, clear chat"
- "Hey Brian, slow mode 30 seconds"
- "Hey Brian, followers only 5 minutes"
- "Hey Brian, emote only"
- "Hey Brian, subscribers only"

## How Chat Mode Commands Work

Since Kick's API doesn't support chat mode commands directly, the bot implements a clever workaround:

1. **Voice Command:** "Hey Brian, slow mode 30 seconds"
2. **Bot Processing:** Recognizes the command and formats it as `/slow on 30`
3. **Chat Message:** Bot sends `/slow on 30` to Kick chat
4. **Moderator Execution:** A moderator (or the streamer) can execute this command
5. **Confirmation:** Bot sends "ðŸ¤– Chat mode command sent: /slow on 30"

This approach allows the bot to support all chat mode features even without direct API support.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. OAuth 2.1 Application Setup

1. Go to [Kick.com Developer Portal](https://kick.com/developer)
2. Create a new OAuth application:
   - **Application Name:** AI Moderator Bot
   - **Redirect URI:** `http://localhost:8000/auth/kick/callback`
   - **Scopes:** Select all available scopes (chat, moderation, etc.)

3. Note down your `client_id` and `client_secret`

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Kick Configuration
KICK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
KICK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
KICK_CHANNEL=your_channel_name_here
KICK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/kick/callback

# Multi-Platform Configuration
ENABLED_PLATFORMS=twitch,kick  # or just 'kick' for Kick only
```

### 3. OAuth Token Setup

Run the OAuth setup script:

```bash
python kick_oauth_setup.py
```

This will:
1. Open your browser to Kick's OAuth page
2. Ask you to authorize the application
3. Automatically save the access and refresh tokens to your `.env` file

### 4. Start the Bot

```bash
python web/main.py
```

The bot will automatically:
- Connect to Kick using your OAuth tokens
- Start monitoring chat for usernames
- Enable voice commands for moderation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing Kick configuration"**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set
   - Check that `KICK_CLIENT_ID`, `KICK_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `KICK_CHANNEL` are configured

2. **"Failed to connect to Kick API"**
   - Verify your OAuth tokens are valid
   - Run `python kick_oauth_setup.py` to refresh tokens
   - Check that your channel name is correct

3. **"Chat mode commands not working"**
   - Ensure you have moderator permissions in the channel
   - Check that the bot account has permission to send chat messages
   - Verify the command format in the chat logs

### Token Refresh

If you encounter authentication errors, your tokens may have expired. Run:

```bash
python kick_oauth_setup.py
```

This will refresh your tokens automatically.

## Platform Comparison

| Feature | Twitch | Kick |
|---------|--------|------|
| Ban/Timeout | âœ… API | âœ… API |
| Unban/Untimeout | âœ… API | âœ… API |

## Security Notes

- OAuth tokens are stored securely in your `.env` file
- The bot only has the permissions you grant during OAuth setup
- All moderation actions are logged for audit purposes
- Username resolution uses AI to prevent targeting innocent users
